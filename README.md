The purpose of this program is to take in a spotify playlist and remove duplicate songs from the artist. Songs will be matched by title, artist, and length. This is in case there are multiple songs of the same title. My goal for this program is to practice more advanced list concepts in python, to lead into more intensive projects

# Steps 

**Completed:**
* create lists
* populate list with numbers
* remove duplicates

**In progress:
* organize list in order of value(smallest ->  largest)

**To be done:**
* Perform this with all chars
* import spotipy
* import playlists and work from there

hopefully this gets finished soon lmao
